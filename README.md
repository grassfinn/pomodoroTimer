## Overview
A Pomodoro timer that allows users to edit their own work timer and rest timer.


### Purpose

Users should be able to:
*start and stop the timer
*edit the timers to their preference in the settings tab
*hear sounds when the timers are over
*see accumulated points they earn as they finish their timers

## My process
*Make the logic for the countdown for minutes and seconds
*Find a way to switch between a break state and work state in order to have certain sounds play after each timer
*Create a settings modal that allows users to input their own custom timers

### Built with

HTML5/CSS3/Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned
The biggest thing I learned during this project was how to use the setInterval function. As you see in the code, the setInterval function is a list of other functions that are checked each second in order for the timer to keep up with the current minutes, seconds, and the different boolean switches.

Breaking doing my project into individual functions was another thing I have been learning and trying to implement more into the projects I do and I think this is a good example of how and why to compartmentalize your code into separate functions.

Understanding how to use CSS position relative and absolute methods to place items on the page was another important feature I learned in the process of the project.

I also learned that you can edit and attach events to the tittle of the HTML document to make it more responsive! Messing with that and learning that you can do that was a fun little challenge.

I also learned how you can user height 100% and overflow hidden to remove the scroll bar from the document so users cannot scroll in undesirable areas such as the settings modal.
### Continued development
I plan to add a todo list feature to the site and implement local storage with the points so users can customize their own Pomodoro!
